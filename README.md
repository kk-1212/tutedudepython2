# Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python  


- **sample1.py** – A program that reads a file and handles errors if the file is missing.  
- **sample2.py** – A program that writes user input to a file, appends more data, and then reads the final content.

## About the Tasks  

### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors  
This program tries to open and read a file named **sample.txt**.  
It prints the file content line by line if the file exists.  
If the file does not exist, the program gracefully handles the error without crashing.

---

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File  
This program works with a file named **output.txt**.  
It performs three steps:  
1. Takes user input and writes it to the file.  
2. Appends extra data to the same file.  
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.  

This task demonstrates writing, appending, and reading from files in Python.
